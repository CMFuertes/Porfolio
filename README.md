Now that you've had some practice with APIs and have a project to share, you'll be updating your portfolio page and other materials to build toward being employer competitive.

If you are opting out of career services, this is *still a required assignment*. Part of being a web developer means being a part of a community. Having a place to share your projects is *necessary* if you're applying for jobs, but is still *critical* on your journey as a developer.


## Requirements

* Updated portfolio featuring project 1 and two exemplary homework assignments. 

* Update GitHub profile with pinned repositories featuring project 1 and two exemplary assignments. 

* Updated resume

* Updated LinkedIn profile

## Instructions

1. ![Updated Portfolio](https://cmfuertes.github.io/Portfolio/)
2. ![GitHub Profile](https://github.com/CMFuertes)
3. ![Updated Resume](https://cmfuertes.github.io/Portfolio/assets/CristhalResume.pdf)
4. ![Updated LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/cristhal-fuertes-8507244a/)

### Updated Portfolio

Your updated site should have the following content:

* Your name

* Links to your GitHub profile & LinkedIn page as well as your email address and phone number

* A link to a PDF of your resume

* A list of projects. For each project, make sure you have the following:

  * Project title

  * Link to the deployed version

  * Link to the GitHub repository

  * Screenshot of the deployed application


#### Design

Unfortunately, this is where it gets a little bit subjective. Your site should look
"polished." Here are a few guidelines on what that means:

* Mobile-first design

* Choose a color palette for your site so it doesn't just look like
the default bootstrap theme or an unstyled HTML site.

* Make sure the font size is large enough to read, and that the colors don't cause eye strain.


### Updated GitHub Profile 

* If you haven't yet, now is the time to update the following in your GitHub profile: 

    * Profile picture

    * Bio

    * Location

    * Email

    * Link to your portfolio

* Employers (and potential collaborators) _will_ look at your GitHub profile, so put your best face forward. 

* Pin some repos that you want to highlight

  * Navigate to [GitHub](https://github.com/) and go to your profile.

  * Click "Customize your pins"

  * Click the checkboxes for your project and 2-3 homework assignments that you would like to share

  * Make sure each of these projects is deployed and add a link to the deployed project in their README files

* Follow your classmates. They are the beginning of your professional network and being a developer is as much about being a part of the community as it is writing code. 


### Updated Resume 

Submit a clear, concise and compelling resume, tailored to the type of job you’re looking for.


### Updated LinkedIn Profile 

Update your LinkedIn Profile with a strong bio statement, a professional photo, and links to your Github and portfolio.

## User Story
The project was to create an updated portfolio based on two months of acquired coding knowledge. Instead of using my previous portfolio I decided to upgrade and start fresh. 

Initially this portfolio was to have multiple pages. However, after browsing through many portfolios, I felt the single page was much cleaner and more my style. 

[Deployed Portfolio](https://cmfuertes.github.io/Portfolio/)

### Inspiration
I was inspired by [Pavel Huza](http://www.pavelhuza.com/)'s porfolio, and went with a much simpler version that matched my style.

I deleted the other pages, and stuck with using only the index.html. Here I created four seperate sections, an intro, an about me, my portfolio, and a contact section.

To add a fun element to my page, upon visiting the site, my name in the header has an animation that will only loop once, otherwise page needs to be refreshed to see it. Animation was provided by [Tobias Ahlin](https://tobiasahlin.com/moving-letters/#9). A js file was created for the sole purpose of running this animation.

After browsing for a proffesional color scheme, I came upon "Minimal Yet Warm" from [Visme](https://visme.co/blog/website-color-schemes/). A seperate stylesheet was made to accomodate color changes from using bootstrap.

I created a logo for myself for "Cristhal Fuertes Designs" with use of [Tailor Brands](https://www.tailorbrands.com/). I put my new logo in my navbar, above my intro, as well as adding an icon to the webpage title tab.

### Portfolio Updates
Navbar was created, linking each menu item to the corresponding sections. About me was updated from previous portfolio. Screenshots, as well as links were added to the portfolio displaying completed projects. Images were given an opacity styling unless hovered over. This was done to subdue the striking contrast of the color of the projects compared to color scheme of my page. Each project has a description as well as the link to the deployed repo page. 

Contact section has had a drastic upgrade from previous portfolio. All buttons work. Upon clicking the email link, users will find the subject line already filled in with my an email set to be sent to me. Phone number will open in cell phone keypads. A link to my updated resume as a pdf has been added. The WhatsApp button will automatically open in WhatsApp with a text ready to be sent to me. Link to gitHub has also been added, along with links to LinkedIn and Instagram. 

### Profile Updates

My linked in has now been updated along with a professional photo, as well as a new thorough personal statement. Github profile has also been updated with an profile picture, short bio, as well as pinned repositories. I started following other classmates as well. 

### Conclusion 

My internet proffesional prescence has drastically been updated due to this homework assignment. My long neglected LinkedIn looks tidy, and my portfolio has a more polished appearance as opposed to my first one. Portfolio is mobile-first ready with working buttons.
